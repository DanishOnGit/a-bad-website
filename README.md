## A really slow website

## Your goal: Make this site performant!

This website is developed to test and improve frontend performance skills of engineers.
I have tried to make it as un-optimized as possible.

You as an engineer needs to identify whats wrong with this site.
For eg: its inefficiently serving images.

Then, you must fix the identified problems so as to make it as performant as possible.

Just clone the repo and start fixing!
